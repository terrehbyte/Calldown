# Calldown Design

The character design for Unity-chan will come from Unity-chan herself, so this
document largely focuses on contributions or guiding ideas about how the game's
overall aesthetic will be assembled.

Assets will be used from the Unity-chan assets as provided on the official
website to supplement audio, user interface, 3D models, 3D animations, and other
needs for the game.

That being said, I'm not a game designer or game artist by any means. ;)

## Level Design

This section largely follows advice given in the following GDC talks:

- [Level Design Workshop: Blockmesh and Lighting Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09r1B9cVEQY)
- [Improving Your Game's Intellectual Property Through Design Principles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJalKJZqAMM)

Fog will obscure areas further than the immediate play space.
